  aboutMe: `I'm Younes, a passionate Software Developer, DevOps enthusiast, and Ethical Hacker focused on building high-quality, secure, and scalable web applications. Currently studying at YouCode (UM6P), I work across the full stack using Java (Spring Boot), Angular, Laravel, Next.js, and Node.js â€” blending backend logic with clean, functional interfaces.

Beyond development, I enjoy debugging, system analysis, and finding vulnerabilities through platforms like HackerOne, where I've earned strong credibility. My goal is simple: to craft reliable, production-ready software and continuously push my technical limits.`,
